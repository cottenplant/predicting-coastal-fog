"June Gloom" is a familiar phenomenon in many parts of California. Named for the month it tends to appear the most frequently, the characteristic fog or marine layer occurs due to temperature differences accross the cold Pacific ocean and typically baking inland temperatures. Presented is an analysis of trends in occurrence of the peculiar weather pattern.

According to Wikipedia.org, fog forms when the differnce between temperature and dew point is less than 2.5 degrees Celsius.

The international definition of fog is a visibility of less than 1 kilometre (3,300 ft); mist is a visibility of between 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) and 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) and haze from 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). (wikipedia.org)

In this analysis, we explore various aspects of weather measurements and trends both at Santa Monica Airport (KSMO) and at Los Angeles International Airpot (KLAX) to tease out the factors leading to marine layer, as well as touch on long-term trends in climate such as those related to climate change.

KSMO data was downloaded via the Wunderground.com API, and KLAX data was acquired through the NOAA portal online.
